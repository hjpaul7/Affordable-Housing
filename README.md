> Affordable Housing Indiana is a resource I created for people in the Indianapolis/IN area to find, add, apply and review Section 8 and Section 42 housing. I saw a lack of information and central "hub" for actual income restricted housing and sought to provide that information. All information is automatically up to date and accurate. I leave that to the users.
